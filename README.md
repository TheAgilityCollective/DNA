# The Agility Collective DNA

Tha agility collective DNA is a web site (or rather, a document) that describes ...how we work and why. The source lives on github and is auto-published on [https://theagilitycollective.github.io/dna/](https://theagilitycollective.github.io/dna/) every time a change is pushed.

**This document is currently ...a work in progress, as we are in the stage of building the collective and formalise our operating principals.  

This site is a fork from DNA.crisp.se
