# The Agility Collective DNA

Tha Agility Collective's DNA is a web site (or document) that describes ...how we work and why. The source lives on github and is auto-published on [https://theagilitycollective.github.io/dna/](https://theagilitycollective.github.io/dna/) every time a change is pushed.

**This document is currently ...a work in progress, as we are in the stage of building the collective and formalise our operating principals.  

This document is a fork of [Swedish Company Crisp](http://DNA.crisp.se) which can be found on github. Many of the operating principles apply to the collective without much modification. Of the ones that don't, the current members of the collective are reviewing and evolving.

Evolving this DNA will be a continual process, first in personalising it to meet our needs, but more importantly to reflect the way we change and adapt as we grow and through fresh input from members.
