Recruitment - how we grow
=========================

Recruitment is actually a misnomer, as we don't actively 'recruit' consultants. However, we are always interested in having "conversaions" with people who 'fit'. People who have a deep understanding of what we are trying to acheive and fresh ideas on how we can continue to grow. 

How did we get consultants?
---------------------------------------------------------

Awesome people required! We recognise that Business agility is a growing field, so finding people with full end-to-end experience are thin on the ground ...or may not even exist at all. But, we are mature operators so have a pretty good idea of "who's" out there. In all likleyhood if you are doing GREAT stuff ...we probably already know about you and may contact you. 

If you havn't been contactet yet, this may just mean we have not crossed paths, so if you think you fit what we are looking for, please contact us. 


Acquire awesome people, or don't acquire at all
-----------------------------------------

Worth repeating: **acquire awesome people, or don't acquire at all!**
That's what [makes our model work](why-this-works.html).

Who gets to join
----------------

There are two major streams of people that fit our profile.
1) Those coming from the IT field directly. Senior coachers and trainers of capital 'A' Agile practices. They are senior in that they often have their own businesses (and probably have been operating sucessfully for a number of years). However, many of the prople coming from this stream have limited ability to extend the conversation outside if the IT realm, so have difficulty communicating mindset and practice outside of a dev/ops environment. 
2) The second stream, and the one we are activly developing, consists of people who are using lean and systems thinking principles outside of IT. Espesally in areas like HR and Finance or more generally in management or change. In many cases these people may not have active experience in a 'transformational sence' but have aninate understanding of the principles involved, and a strong desire to influence change.

In many cases the people we speak to are already recognised as leaders in specialist areas, and running their own business. In many cases these people have found the've hit a glass ceiling in what their own practice can acheive, so being part of a collective will help them grow both professionally and personally. They recognise that being part of a collective extents their reach and influence, in terms of building new business, and that they can focus on delivery and less time in building their practice.  

A main aim of the collective is to support the continued development of our members. For instance, to activly encourage and suppport members in continuing to develop their individual though-leader profiles and brand. We do not see this as a conflict. In saying this, another aim (or kpi of the collective) is that members also see and understand the benifit of working to build the collective, and sopport the collectives own brand ...and equally committed to this as well. So, some balance of priorities may be necessary. 

The on-boarding process. 
---------

If we havn't worked with you before, then the first step starts with you. Make sure you read and fully understand 1) our principles and DNA of how we operate, and 2) what we are trying to achive (from the website). For many people, it's obvious this wont work, and little time is wasted, it should only take about 15min to work that out.

The next step starts as a conversation, usually with a founding member of the collective (who acts as a puller, similar to the bun holder in our [bun protocol](bun-protocol.html).) If this goes well, we will invite, or ask your permission ...to "continue the conversation". This is code for: it looks like we have good alignment. 

We don't like to use the word trial but it's kinda a trial in that you get a better sence of how we work and whats expected of you, and we get a better sence of how you operate and the value you are bringing. All going well, this conversation would include us giving you access to behind the scenes activity, trello boards, zoom meeting etc. This way we are all comfortable with where things are going. 

The formal process follows out democratic principles 
----
1.  Someone at the Collective is willing to be a "puller" for the candidate. That's our internal term for the person "pulling" an initiative and making sure things move forward, and that the candidate is well-treated. Similar to the bun holder in our [bun protocol](bun-protocol.html).
2.  At least one us has worked with the candidate before. We want someone to say "Hey, I've worked with her before, she's awesome! We'd be IDIOTS not to let her join!" or we have gone through the 
'conversation" satve above.
3.  No one has vetoed the candidate.

This considerably limits the number of applicants.

If accepted ...Welcome! You'll need to sign our [team contract](team-contract-en.html), and create your own personal company (if you don't already have one). Formally you'll be employed by your company, not 'the collective'. We'll help you get started.

Congrats, you are now your own manager! Be nice.

We will also go for dinner at a nice restaurant, setup your email account and all that jazz, like most other companies. And we'll proudly display you on our [site](http://theagilitycollective.com) of course!

Other things
-----

Other things that we value and use to help us determine who to accept and reject (but don't always require):

-   The candidate complements us somehow, for example with new skills or perspectives that we lack. He/she will make us feel like newbies in some area!
-   The candidate has lots of energy and ideas, and won't be shy to challenge the status quo.
-   The candidate is well known and has a strong reputation in the industry.
-   Shares our values. (well this one is more of a requirement.. but it's more of a springboard for discussion, and not an easy black and white answer)

> Tips to candidates: Inspire us! Show us your skills, technical and social! Present something new and exciting at one of our events, or join us for a [hack summit](hack-summit.html). Prepare for lots of intense discussions, critique and laughter – we’re a merry bunch, but we need to be convinced you are good at what you do. Why? Because we want to learn from you, and we want the clients to rave over how awesome you are. We are all investing much time spent building up a great reputation, and we want you to make it even better!

Don't steal people from clients!
--------------------------------

One golden rule as a consultant is to never ever hire a co-worker from a client. Managers obviously don't want consultants to steal their employees, so we won't recruit a candidate until after both the candidate and the consultant have left the place where they worked together. Sometimes years after.

We are in no hurry to grow. An awesome person is worth waiting for.

What kind of people don't fit at our model?
---------------------------------------

People who want stability don't fit. You won't have stable working hours and a fixed desk. You won't even get a fixed salary - in fact, it's the other way around - you pay a fee (but keep most of what you earn). See the [economic model](economic-model.html). So when you don't have a client, you bleed money every month! On the other hand, when you do have a client, you earn more than what any company would pay you in salary. So it's up to you to buffer cash and manage risk.

This kind of model obviously doesn't fit everyone.

What kind of people do fit here?
------------------------------------

Most people who end up at the Collective were previously independent consultants (or were heading in that direction). Typical personality traits:

-   **Self-confident** - they know that they are highly skilled and in high demand.
-   **Adventurous** - a few months without an assignment isn't the end of the world, it's an opportunity to play around and learn new stuff!
-   **Social** - they like to maintain a strong network and collaborate with people. Some of us are introverts, but still kind of social)
-   **Curious** - want to learn new things, every day. Love geeking out better ways of doing things, or new techniques and technologies, processes, etc.
-   **Generous** - like to share what they learn, not primarily for profit but because it's fun and rewarding in itself.
-   **Responsible** - they're used to taking responsibility for their own goals and actions, and don't wait for others to tell them what to do or solve their problems.

Of course, not everyone here has all these traits. But this is typically the type of person who is attracted to us.
