Ownership model
===============

The Agility Colletve is a limited libility company. This means there are shares, and someone has to own them.

So who owns us? How are new owners brought in? What does ownership mean?

Our model is simple: **anyone who has been at the Agility Collective for 2+ years can become an owner.**

> Why 2 years? Although we are notoriously [picky with recruiting](recruiting.html), we **might** screw up and bring in a bad apple. We'll probably notice and get rid of a bad apple faster than 2 years! The 2 year rule reduces the risk that the bad apple is also a shareholder, which would complicate the getting-rid-of process.

Now you might thinking "Huh, so *anyone* is allowed to become a partner? Really?".

Exactly! The idea is that, if we wouldn't trust someone to co-own the company, why would we trust them to represent the Collective at all? So if, after two years, we don't trust a member enough to offer them ownership, that's a sign they shouldn't be at here at all. 


So, every year around July we send an invite to all non-owners who have been around for at least 2 years, and ask them if they want to become owners.

What does ownership cost?
-------------------------

We strive to minimize the financial value of the company. I know, that's the opposite of what other companies do. But remember, the purpose of The Agility Collective is not to enrich it's owners. The purpose is to [help consultants be happy](what-is-theagilitycollective.html).

> We've all seen consulting companies that work like pyramid schemes - where old-timers are like fat cats parasiting from the hard work of newcomers. That's exactly what we **don't** want to be.

So our shares are pretty fixed at the lowest possible price that allowed under regulatory compliance. 

When you become an owner (which is entirely optional), you buy stock at that low price. You will have the exact same amount of stock as the other owners. And if/when you leave Crisp, you must sell your stock back at basically the same price. For details, see [contracts](contracts.html).

This means there is no financial incentive to own stocks, no cashing out.

What does ownership actually mean?
----------------------------------

Ownership means very little in practical terms. You won't get rich, and you won't gain more influence (power is gained through meritocracy, not ownership - see our [decision process](decisions.html)). In theory there are situations where ownership CAN make a difference, like if our normal decision process completely breaks down and we have to resort to shareholder voting for a critical decision. But that almost never happens.


What if someone buys us?
---------------------------

In theory someone could come along and shell out a bunch of cash to buy us, and in that case the owners would in a sense cash out. But with the current structure we see that as extremely unlikely. The business itself is just a container, a platform. The real value is the consultants, and they aren't even employed by us. So although someone can technically buy us out, they can't really buy the people inside. And besides, who would buy a company that explicitly strives to minimize it's financial value.

But who knows. The world can be strange sometimes.
