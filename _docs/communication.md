Communication
=============

Our **main internal communication channels** are:

-   [Our Unconference](unconference.html) twice per year.
-   Pulse meetings (or mini-conferences). These happen about twice per year, in between the unconferences. Typically a half day or whole day with some kind of theme, like "how we make decisions" or "how we handle conflict" or "how we run courses".
-   Team mailing list - a single mailing list with everyone on it. We use simple [email conventions](email-conventions.html) to separate must-read stuff from general discussions, and the [Bun protocol](bun-protocol.html) to route client inquiries to the right consultant.
-   [Board meetings](board.html) every month.
-   [Zoom](http://zoom.com) for regular online video meetings (often between teams) 
-   [Slack](http://www.slack.com) for chattier stuff.
-   [Trello](http://trello.com) for collaborating on activities


Most decisions are made, and most problems solved, in one of the above forums.

A lot of good communication will happen at our [hack-summit](hack-summit.html), although the purpose is more to geek out together than to communicate :)

Where we **store info**:

-   Google Docs - we used it for almost everything now-a-days. Our main doc is the [dashboard](dashboard.html)
-   Dropbox - we have a dropbox account that we used for shared docs that don't fit in google docs.
-   GitHub - a github organization account for shared code and, well, the DNA that you are reading right now.

How we **communicate with the outside world**:

-   Our website - [theagilitycollective.com](http://theagilitycollective.com)
-   Our blog - [theagilitycollective.com/blog](http://theagilitycollective.com/blog)
-   A mailing list for our customers and course participants, we send information about upcoming courses about once or twice per quarter.
-   Twitter - our twitter handle is [@123agility](https://twitter.com/123agility/)
-   [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/18158595/)
-   Through speaking and workshops at confrences and [events](http://theagilitycollective.com/tag/speaking/)
-   At local (public) [meet-ups](http://theagilitycollective.com/tag/meetup/)
-   ... but the biggest channel of communication is of course the personal and informal channels - our members own tweeting, blogging, and talking to friends and customers. Together we have a huge network!
