What is The Agility Collective and why?
======================

**The Agility Collective is a home for agile/lean business consultants who value:**

-   **Community** - We like to hang out with people who share our values
-   **Freedom** - We want to control our own time
-   **Competence** - We want to continuously learn
-   **Good citizenship** - Heart over wallet (money isn't the main thing in life)
-   **Professionalism** - We genuinely care about solving our customers problems

We believe these values lead to personal happiness as well as business success.

Basically, we're trying to find the magic balance between being an independent consultant (full freedom, no support), and being an employee (little freedom, lots of support).

The model allows us build a business that draw from a deep and rich pool of talent. This allows us with the diversity and experienced practitioneys capable of solving the complex needs f our clients.
