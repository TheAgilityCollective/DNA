Visions
=======

In many ways the Agility Collective is just a platform. We don't have a Vision (with a Big V), we just want the Collective to be a [nice home for consultants](what-is-theagilitycollective.html).

However, many of the *people* here do have a vision. Here are the most widely shared visions:

**Vision 1: "Help companies benefit from Lean/Agile"**

**Vision 2: "Develop companies and organizations so the people there can be happy, improve, and create increasing value."**


Why do we have multiple visions?
--------------------------------

Because people don't all have to want the same thing. We're in this home together because we have a common set of values, not because we have to have the same vision and goals. People can work on whatever they are passionate about, and if enough other Crispers share the same passion it implicitly becomes a our collective vision.

How we work with visions
------------------------

We're guided by these principles (which are reviewed and agreed at the [unconferences](unconference.html)):

-   the Collective can have several visions.
-   They can and should only be changed at our unconferences, so everyone can discuss.
-   The visions apply between the unconferences.
-   If you miss an unconference, you are automatically considered to "stand aside" (see our [hand signals](hand-signals.html)).


It is a standing vote, where people can move their avatars to show their stance on each of the suggested vision statements. As discussion happens and the statements are improved, people move their avatars around. Gradually we reach strong consensus on two of them (and perhaps even on a third one).

Two more principles:

-   It's OK to move your avatar up and down even between conferences. But that will be considered input to the next conference, no decision will be made directly.
-   We bring this poster to our conferences, so we keep iterating on it.

Does everyone have to agree with these visions?
-----------------------------------------------

No. As long as most members are comfortable. And not to agree probably just indicates other personal priorities.
