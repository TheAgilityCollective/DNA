What is this?
=============

This site (or document) describes our operating model ...the how we work, and why. This model is based on the [open-source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) Crisp DNA, forked on github. We are using the Crisp model fairly vanilla, in recognition of their many years of evolving it. Although they may have a very different business, we share many of their values. If ...in time, some things don't fit, then we will just adapt and evolve.

[The Agility Collective](http://theagilitycollective.com) is a consulting company operating in Australia and New Zealand. Like Crisp, we do not aspire to be a typical consulting company. For example:

-   None of the consultants are actually employed by {{ site.company_name }}.
-   We have no managers, or even a CEO. Instead we rely on self-organization and transparency. Almost everything is bottom-up, and [anyone can drive any decision](decisions.html).
-   Our main **purpose** is to enable consultants to be happy, and [our Happiness Index](happiness-index.html) is our driving metric. Strong revenue and delighted customers are a side effect, not a goal.
-   The Collective doesn't want to earn money from it's consultants. It is in practice a non-profit company (although not formally so). Consultants [keep most of what they earn](economic-model.html).
-   Our [ownership model](ownership-model.html) is designed to keep our stock financially worthless. There is no incentive to "cash in".
-   Consultants are 100% autonomous. They can do whatever they want (as long as they don't hurt the brand or [our house](what-is-theagilitycollective.html)), and work as much or as little as they want.
